# 🐍 Phase 1 — Python Fundamentals  
### 🎯 *Build a strong foundation in Python syntax, logic, and problem-solving.*

> “First, master the basics — everything else becomes easier.”

---

## 📘 **Learning Goals**
By the end of this phase, you will:
- Understand Python’s syntax, types, and variables  
- Write clean programs using loops, conditionals, and functions  
- Manipulate strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries  
- Use modules, file I/O, and exceptions  
- Develop logical and problem-solving skills through 50 hands-on exercises
